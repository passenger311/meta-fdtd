These setups simulate the above-threshold field dynamics in a ZnO semiconductor nanowire plasmonic laser for different boundary conditions.

Finite: Finite (i.e. full) wire
PBC: Periodic boundary conditions -> often this leads to a propagating wave in one or the other direction along the wire
PEC: Perfect electrical conductor -> standing wave pattern similar to that of finite wire
