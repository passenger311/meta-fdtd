The setup simulates the above-threshold field dynamics in a ZnO semiconductor nanowire plasmonic laser. 
The gain material is modelled as a 4lvl system with an initial inversion of 0.7, which is continously pumped with a spatially homogeneous pump rate.
After initial relaxation oscillations a steady state is reached.

The FDTD resolution of this active run is 10nm.

To create the input files, type
> luacfg run_config.lua 140
where 140 is the nanowire diameter in nm.

To use qscript, first execute the luacfg command.
