The setup simulates the above-threshold field dynamics in a ZnO semiconductor nanowire plasmonic laser of 'infinite' length. 
The gain material is modelled as a 4lvl system with an initial inversion of 0.7, which is continously pumped with a spatially homogeneous pump rate.
After initial relaxation oscillations a steady state is reached.

The FDTD resolution of this active run is 5nm.

To create the input files, type e.g.
> luacfg run_config.lua 140 315
where 140 is the nanowire diameter in nm and 315 is the length of the wire between the PBC boundaries, also in nm.

To use qscript, first execute the luacfg command.
