The setup implemented here computes the effective refractive index of a material slab in vacuum.
In order to do this the complex transmission and reflection coefficients are measured within fdtd.
Then Matlab is used to compute the refractive index and the permittivity from these coefficients.

The formula implemented in the Matlab program fft_eps.m is taken from Smith et al; PRB 65, 195104 (2009).


Execution:
 First use ./run
 then start Matlab and type fft_eps


Tips:
 - In order to get a higher frequency resolution increase n_cycles in scale.lua.
 - The accuracy is higher if fft in scale.lua is increased, though this can lead to 
   phase shifts of more than 2pi in the material which in turn makes a branch selection
   necessary. This is not implemented.
