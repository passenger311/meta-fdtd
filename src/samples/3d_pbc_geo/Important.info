Three dimensional setup with two four periodic boundaries and two PMLs for transmission and reflection graphs.
The geometry is taken from Hu et al, Optics Express, Vol. 17, Issue 19, pp. 16745-16749.
The material response used is more accurate in the given frequency region and seems to lead to qualitatively different results.
