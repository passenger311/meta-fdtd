Calculation of the local density of optical states (LDOS) in 2d for the stopped light plasmonic heterostructure for wavelengths around 1550nm (f=193THz).

Type the following to generate the FDTD config files
> luacfg config.lua 0
with 0 being the distance of the dipole from the substrate. The dipole polarization can be changed in config.lua.

After calculating the time-series of the field strength at the position of the dipole, greens_function.m can be used to determine the LDOS at this point.
Make sure that the %%%Setup parameters in the matlab file match those in SRCHARDJ in config.0.in.
