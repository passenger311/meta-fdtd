Calculation of the local density of optical states (LDOS) in 3d for the stopped light plasmonic heterostructure for wavelengths around 1550nm (f=193THz).

Type the following to generate the FDTD config files
> luacfg config.lua 0
with 0 being the distance of the dipole from the substrate. The dipole polarization can be changed in config.lua.

After calculating the time-series of the field strength at the position of the dipole, greens_function.m can be used to determine the LDOS at this point.
Make sure that the %%%Setup parameters in the matlab file match those in SRCHARDJ in config.0.in.

Careful, in 3D the PML boundary conditions are problematic in this setup and lead to exponentially increasing fields at late times.
