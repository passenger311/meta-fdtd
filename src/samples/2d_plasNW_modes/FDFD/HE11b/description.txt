This calculates the mode profile of a mode with complex index close to the one give in neff.lua using FDFD.
The example file is that of a dielectric nanowire on top of a flat silver half-plane.

To start the calculation type
> luacfg run_config.lua 70 380 2000
with 60: cylinder radius
     380: wavelength
     5000: distance to sides (this must be large enough, so that PMLs can be added in wgmode3k.m)

Lua will automatically start the matlab script.
Careful, it will use a lot of RAM
