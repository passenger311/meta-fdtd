The example is a semiconductor ZnO wire on top of a metal sheet, i.e. the case of a nanowire plasmonic laser. 
It can be used to calculate reflection coefficients at the wire end.

First, the geometry is set up also writing geo files for the injection plane. These are used to solve for a mode close to the given neff guess value. The mode solver returns the solver for neff value in neff.lua and additionaly writes the injection fields into tfsfex_re.in, tfsfex_im.in, tfsfey_re.in and tfsfey_im.in.
The setup can be used in forward direction but also for a finite wire where reflection measurements can be made. Unfortunately, for this example of a plasmonic wire, the wave injection is poor and strong interference between the reflected fields and the injection errors is observed. This should not be the case in a dielectric setting or for very high resolution.

The reflected power flow can be studied in a number of defined planes Sz0 to Sz4 and the profile of the power flow can be mapped onto the waveguide modes using mode_overlap.m. This matlab file loads a chosen FDTD F_*_*.set file and the mode files Emode*_re.set, Emode*_im.set, Hmode*_re.set and Hmode*_im.set from the mode solver. The result is an overlap percentage.
The following parameters are required to run the matlab file:
mode_overlap(file,file_mode,freqnumber,fig_on);
with 
  file: 'xy1', use FDTD files F_xy1_*.set
  file_mode: '1.58', use mode files Emode1.58_re.set, etc.
  freqnumber: 1, use FDTD files F_*_1.set
  fig_on: 1, figures on; 0, figures off
