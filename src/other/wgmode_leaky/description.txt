The mode solver has been changed to read in and solve for complex permittivity.
Also, the code has been optimized to run faster in matlab.

In addition, this example supports PMLs at the edges of the domain. This way leaky modes can be found

The example is a dielectric wire on top of a metal, i.e. the case of a nanowire plasmonic laser.
