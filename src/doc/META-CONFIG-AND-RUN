META: HOW-TO CONFIGURE AND RUN 
------------------------------

J. Hamm 8/12/2007


1. THE BUILD DIRECTORY


After a successful build the meta3-build directory contains everything 
necessary to configure and run a simulation. As such it can be copied to
a different (compatible) host or location.


2. THE MASTER CONFIGURATION FILE


Each simulation has a master configuration file which contains all the
parameter and object definitions which are required by the engine. The 
master configuration file is parsed by the Meta-3 pre-processesor.


3. EXECUTION LAYERS


* meta-config pre-processor: reads master configuration (.cfg) file, writes
  engine input files (.in).

* meta-engine: reads the engine input files (.in), computes and writes output 
  data in formats as specified in the input (e.g. .gpl)

* meta post-processing: the post-processor consists of a series of scripts 
  which allow to process the engines output data. This is usually only 
  necessary if a parallel engine is used. In that case the output data is
  scattered over paritition files which need to be stitched together.
