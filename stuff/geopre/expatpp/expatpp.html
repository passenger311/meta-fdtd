See <A HREF="http://www.jclark.com/xml/expatfaq.html">expatFAQ</A> for more details on expat (and I hope I've got all thispublic license stuff correct :-).</P><P>Our shell can be downloaded from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.highway1.com.au/pub/adsoftware/xml/">ftp://ftp.highway1.com.au/pub/adsoftware/xml/</A>and includes the expat release we use, thanks kindly to James Clarkfor bundling permission.</P><P>The current production version of expat can be downloaded from<A HREF="ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/xml/expat.zip">ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/xml/expat.zip</A>if you are chasing a later version than we've had time to test.</P><H2>   <hr>  Release News</H2><p>20020114</p><p>Tested with CodeWarrior Pro7.1 and Visual C++ v6 using expat v1.2 with no need   to change the expatpp code.</p><H2>   <HR>  Release News</H2><P>19990605</P><P>This version of expatpp includes a subclass that makes it veryeasy to build families of nesting parsers. The nesting approach wasused in our OOFILE report-writer which saves report layout and dataout to XML files and allows them to be read back into our previewwindow. The OOFILE source files oofriXML.cpp and oofriXML.h areincluded as a demonstration of how to use nested parsers and may befreely copied.</P><P>Note: the OOF_XMLrepLayoutParser was first developed by one of my programmers   before the nesting parser concept and so uses a somewhat awkward state model.   It has been left that way as it provides a good example of how nested parsers   have simplified writing parsers. </P><P> Start with OOF_XMLrepParser::startElement to see how the nested parsers are   created.</P><H2><HR>Build Notes</H2><P>The directory <SAMP>samp_pp</SAMP> contains testexpat.c which is aplain expat demo for CodeWarrior copied from elements.c and modifiedto open a specified file rather than stdin and a CharacterDataHandleradded. It also contains testexpatpp.cpp which is a C++ equivalentusing expatpp. It also contains oofriXML.* as a demonstration of howto use nested parsers.</P><P>The directory <SAMP>src_pp</SAMP> contains the XML parser objectexpatpp in two source files, built on top of the <SAMP>expat</SAMP>source. See the header file expatpp.h for instructions.</P><P>The directory <SAMP>xpcw</SAMP> contains <A HREF="http://www.metrowerks.com/">CodeWarrior</A>Pro4 &amp; Pro5 project to build a demo using testexpatpp.cpp. Thisproject has been built with Apple's Universal Headers 3.2. Unlikeearlier project stationery, the MacOS.lib file in the 68K target hasbeen replaced with interface.o due to linker conflicts.</P><P>These projects expect the expat source directory to be addedwithin the expatpp directory, ie:</P><PRE>expatpp   expat   expatpp.html   samp_pp   src_pp   xpcw   xpvc</PRE><P>The directory vc_pp contains a Visual C++ v6 project to buildstatic libraries for expatpp. Contributions for other targetsgratefully accepted.</P><P>When you run the sample, entering a filename such assimpleTable.xml will cause that file to be parsed and the resultsdisplayed on the console.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><ADDRESS><A HREF="mailto:dent@oofile.com.au">Andy Dent</A><BR>Resident guru on too many damn platforms</ADDRESS><ADDRESS><A HREF="http://www.oofile.com.au/">A.D.
